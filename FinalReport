After that, we will compare, analyze and conduct a T test to reject the null hypothesis.

To find their distances, at first, we thought a simple minimum distance algorithm with time complexity O(n^2) would work, but as airbnb dataset has almost 50,000 rows and the other datasets have ~2000 rows, it took to long to compute the minimum distance from airbnb properties to schools, cafes and businesses. Therefore, we imported BallTree library to decide the closest one for each airbnb locations. Then, we splitted the data into 2 regarding their nearby school and cafe or business. After that, we compared the student data with working data, rejected the null hypothesis for one feature and failed to reject for another 2 features. Finally, we tried kNN and Decision Trees modeling for the same data, with different hyperparameters, and found the best accuracy which is 71%. As a result, we can guess the people who stay in an airbnb property whether they are student or worker with the 71% accuracy. We can say that a solution with %71 accuracy is acceptable when using a dataset this large, however it must be noted a disadvantage exist: It is not perfect either and must be treated accordingly, when conducting a very sensitive research this research may not help very much, when there is a tolerance for some mispredictions it is applicable. On the other hand, in the light of our research results, we can see that there is indeed a correlation between our features and student/worker classification. Our advantage is that, people may extend this research and solve different research problems with higher accuracy.\n"]}]}
